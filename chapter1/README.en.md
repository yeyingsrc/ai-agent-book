# Chapter 1 · Agent Fundamentals

> Starting from the new paradigm of "Model as Agent," establishes the core formula **Agent = LLM + Context + Tools**, and introduces Harness engineering—all engineering capabilities beyond the model are the true competitive advantage.

## Companion Projects

| Project | Type | Description |
| --- | :--: | --- |
| [learning-from-experience](learning-from-experience/) | ✅ | Compares traditional reinforcement learning (Q-learning) with LLM-based in-context learning, reproducing key insights from Shunyu Yao's "The Second Half" blog post. Demonstrates how LLMs can surpass traditional RL with 250-400x sample efficiency through a treasure hunt game. |
| [web-search-agent](web-search-agent/) | ✅ | Implements an Agent with basic deep search capabilities, capable of multi-round searching and information integration. |
| [search-codegen](search-codegen/) | ✅ | Builds an Agent with basic deep search and code sandbox capabilities, utilizing tools like web search and code execution for complex analysis. |
| [context](context/) | ✅ | Demonstrates the importance of various Agent context components through systematic ablation experiments. Supports multiple LLM providers (SiliconFlow Qwen, ByteDance Doubao, Moonshot Kimi), allowing configuration of different context modes to observe changes in Agent behavior. |
