## Companion Projects

| Project | Type | Description |
| --- | :--: | --- |
| [gaia-experience](gaia-experience/) | ✅ | Based on the AWorld framework and GAIA benchmark, implements a complete "learn-apply" loop. The agent automatically summarizes successful task trajectories into structured experiences and retrieves and applies them in new tasks, achieving self-evolution. |
| [browser-use-rpa](browser-use-rpa/) | ✅ | Implements a workflow recording system for browser automation, automatically encapsulating repetitive operation sequences into parameterized tools. By switching from expensive LLM inference to precise automated execution, it achieves a 3-5x speed improvement. |
| [prompt-distillation](prompt-distillation/) | ✅ | Distills the effectiveness of complex prompts into model parameters, reducing prompt length during inference and solidifying contextual experience into parameterized knowledge. |
| [prompt-auto-optimization](prompt-auto-optimization/) | ✅ | Automated system prompt learning based on human feedback: Using the tau-bench style airline customer service "over-transfer" problem as an example, a Coding Agent reads the system prompt file, identifies problematic rules, generates precise modifications, and actually rewrites the prompt file. It then re-evaluates the changes, forming a "feedback → rewrite → verify" loop. |
| [self-evolving-tools](self-evolving-tools/) | ✅ | An Alita-style "minimal predefined, maximum self-evolution" approach: The agent has no pre-built domain-specific tools, only five general meta-tools. When encountering a task it cannot perform, it searches the web for open-source libraries/APIs, reads documentation, tests them in a sandbox, encapsulates feasible solutions as new tools, stores them in the tool library for reuse, and emphasizes hallucination control throughout the process. |
| [self-evolution-eval](self-evolution-eval/) | ✅ | A dedicated dataset and validation methodology designed to evaluate an agent's "self-evolution" capability (discovering, creating, and reusing tools on its own): 20 cross-domain tasks (without hinting at tool names) + a four-layer hierarchical validation harness + a controllable reference agent. It goes beyond checking "if the result is correct" to assess the quality of discovery, creation, and reuse. |
