# Chapter 4 · Tools

> Tools are the hands of an Agent. Discusses tool classification and general design principles, the MCP protocol and challenges of tool selection, three types of tools (perception, execution, collaboration), and event-driven asynchronous Agents.

## Companion Projects

| Project | Type | Description |
| --- | :--: | --- |
| [perception-tools](perception-tools/) | ✅ | Build a comprehensive set of perception tools, providing capabilities for web search, multimodal understanding, file system operations, and access to public data sources. Most features are based on free, open APIs (DuckDuckGo, Open-Meteo, Yahoo Finance, OpenStreetMap, etc.) and require no API key. |
| [execution-tools](execution-tools/) | ✅ | Implement a set of execution tools with safety mechanisms, including file operations, a code interpreter, a virtual terminal, and external system integration. Prevent dangerous operations through a secondary LLM approval mechanism, automatically summarize complex outputs, and perform syntax validation on code. |
| [collaboration-tools](collaboration-tools/) | ✅ | Provide comprehensive collaboration capabilities, including browser automation (browser-use framework), Human-in-the-Loop, multi-channel notifications (Email, Telegram, Slack, Discord), and timer management. Supports admin approval for sensitive operations and scheduled task dispatching. |
| [agent-with-event-trigger](agent-with-event-trigger/) | ✅ | A modern event-driven Agent built with FastAPI, integrating all tools from the first three MCP servers by default. It uses a native asynchronous architecture for clean MCP tool loading and receives multi-source events (Web, Instant Messaging, GitHub, Timers, etc.) via HTTP API. Provides automatic API documentation (Swagger UI) and background monitoring capabilities. |
| [active-tool-selection](active-tool-selection/) | ✅ | Implement an intelligent tool selection mechanism that allows the Agent to actively choose the most suitable combination of tools based on task requirements, rather than passively accepting a predefined tool set. |
| [active-tool-discovery](active-tool-discovery/) | ✅ | Compares two paradigms: "injecting all 120+ tool schemas" vs. "active on-demand discovery." The latter keeps only a few basic tools and a `discover_tools` meta-tool in the system prompt, using embedding similarity to retrieve the 3-5 most relevant specialized tools from a tool library. This saves tokens and prevents the model from incorrectly selecting or misusing general tools from an overly long list. |
| [async-agent](async-agent/) | ✅ | Implement the core of an event-driven asynchronous Agent framework (Flux) based on a single-threaded asyncio model: an inbox event queue dispatches tasks by urgency (interrupt/immediate/queue), supports parallel execution of asynchronous tools, allows interrupting the current turn during execution, and provides cancellation and status querying for simulated long-running tasks. Decision-making is performed by a real LLM (function calling). |

> Additionally, `chapter4/docker-compose.yml` and `chapter4/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` provide a reference solution for containerizing and deploying the aforementioned MCP tool servers.
