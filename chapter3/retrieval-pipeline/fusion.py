"""Result fusion for hybrid retrieval.

This module implements the *fusion* stage of the hybrid retrieval pipeline —
the step that merges the separately-ranked dense and sparse candidate lists into
a single, unified candidate pool before neural reranking.

Two production-grade fusion strategies are provided, matching the two approaches
discussed in the book (第3章「混合检索流水线」):

1. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
   score(d) = Σ_r  1 / (k + rank_r(d))
   Only ranks are used, original scores are discarded. Robust and scale-free,
   because it never has to compare a cosine similarity against a BM25 score.

2. Weighted score fusion (min-max normalized)
   score(d) = Σ_r  w_r * normalize_r(score_r(d))
   Keeps the original relevance signal, at the cost of having to align the two
   score scales via per-list min-max normalization.

Both functions take ranked lists of ``(doc_id, score)`` tuples (sorted by score
descending) and return a fused list of ``(doc_id, fused_score)`` tuples, also
sorted descending. A document that appears in only one list is still fused —
its contribution from the missing list is simply zero.
